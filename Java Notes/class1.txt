Comments in java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Using comments we can improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommended to use comments in our regular programming.

Diagram: 

Comments are not compiled by the compiler. Hence they won't come in output.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple line comment 
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/


ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{
	//main method	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//variable declaration 
		int x=10;

		//output statement
		System.out.println(x);	
	}
}

Interview Questions
===================

Q) what is the difference between JDK,JRE and JVM?

JDK
----
JDK is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE 
---
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
---
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
