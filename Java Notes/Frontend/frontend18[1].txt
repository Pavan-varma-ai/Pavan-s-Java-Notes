Q) What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?

Java						JavaScript 
-----------					-------------
It is a non-scripting language.			It is a scripting language.

It is a strongly typed checking language.	It is a weakly typed checking language.

It can be run individually.			It can't run individually.	

It does not required browser window for 	It requires browser window for execution.
execution.

It is a object oriented programming language.	It is a object based programming language.

It is complex language.				It is easy language.	


History of javaScript 
======================
Original name of JavaScript is a LiveScript.

LiveScript was developed by Netscape Corporation in the year of 1990's.

In 1995, A popular scientist of Netscape Corporation renamed LiveScript to JavaScript.

JavaScript is a loosely typed checking language.

Offical name of JavaScript is ECMA script.

ECMA stands for Europeon Computer Manufacturer Association.


Advantages of javaScript 
========================
1) It is used to develop interactive web pages. 

2) It display dialog boxes and pop-up boxes.

3) It is used to add dynamic content in web page.

4) It is a weakly typed checking languag.

5) It is used to perform client side form validation.

6) It supports drag and drop menu.

7) It supports date and time.

8) It supports cookies.

9) It supports objects like Date,String,RegEx and etc.

and etc.

JavaScript Syntax
==================
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
	-
	- stmt1;
	- stmt2;
	- 
</script>

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
            document.write("Welcome to JavaScript");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
	Here  type and language attributes are optional.
	Here semicolon is optional.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            document.write("Welcome to JavaScript")
       </script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript");
            document.writeln("This is Niyaz Sir class");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

We can't mix markup language with scripting language.
ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript");
           <br>
            document.writeln("This is Niyaz Sir class");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

To overcome above limitatio we need to use below code.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript");
            document.writeln("<br>");
            document.writeln("This is Niyaz Sir class");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

If any document contains HTML , CSS and JavaScript then it is called DHTML.
DHTML stands for Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            document.writeln("<h1 style='color:blue;'>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>");
            document.writeln("<br>");
            document.writeln("<p style='font-size:40px;background-color:cyan;'>This is Niyaz Sir class</p>");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

JavaScript Engine 
==================
JavaScript engine allows to execute javascript code in a browser window.

It is used to convert user understandable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

By default every browser contains javascript engine.

ex:
	Browser 		JavaScript Engine 
	----------		----------------
	Chrome			V8 engine 
	Firefox			spidermonkey 
	Edge			Chakra 
	and etc.	



JavaScript comments
====================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve the readability of our code.

In javascript, we have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment
-----------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here  

2) Multiple line comment 
-------------------------
	It is more convenient because we can comment a single line as well as multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			-
			-
		*/

Output statements in javascript
================================
Whenever we want to display any userdefined statements or data then we need to use output statement.

We have two types of output statements in javascript.

1) document.writeln()

2) console.log() 		

1) document.writeln()
---------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            document.writeln("Welcome to Javascript");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

2) console.log() 
--------------
It is used to display the output on browser console.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            console.log("Welcome to Javascript");
       </script>
</body>
</html>

JavaScript variables 
====================
A name which is given to a memory location is called variable.

Purpose of variable is used to store the data.

In javascript, variables are also known as identifiers.

We have same rules for variables as we have rules for identifiers.

Rules to declare a variable
----------------------------
Rule1:
------
	Variable must and should starts with alphabet, underscore or dollar symbol 
	but not with digit.
	ex:
		var a123; //valid 
		var _abcd; //valid 
		var $alary; //valid 
		var 1abdcd; //invalid 

Rule2:
-----
	Every variable is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int number;
		int NUMBER;
		int NumBer;	

In javascript, we have two types of variables.

1) Local variables 

2) Global variables 

1) Local variables 
------------------
If we declare a variable inside the function or a block is called local variable.

Local variable we can access with in the function only. 

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            function f1()
            {
                //local variable 
                var i=10;

                document.writeln(i);
            }

            //call 
            f1();
       </script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            function f1()
            {
                //local variable 
                var i=10;

                document.writeln(i);
            }
            function f2()
            {
                document.writeln(i); // invalid 
            }

            //call 
            f1();
            f2();
       </script>
</body>
</html>

2) Global variables 
-------------------
If we declare any variable outside the function or a block is called global variable.

Global variable we can access within the function and outside the function.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            //global variable 
            var i=100;

            function f1()
            {
                document.writeln(i); 
            }

            //calling 
            f1();
       </script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
       <script >
            //global variable 
            var i=100;

            function f1()
            {
                document.writeln(i); 
            }

            function f2()
            {
              document.writeln(i);
            }

            //calling 
            f1();
            f2();
       </script>
</body>
</html>
